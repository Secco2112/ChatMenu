# ChatMenu

Inspired by the Babyforce's Press2Text mod!

This simple menu allows you to send messages quickly to other players.

How to use:
Go to "Options">"Mod Keybinds">Select "Chat Menu" and map a key to open it.

Features:

    Menu just open if you're on a heist;
    Some messages can only be selected in specific heists or specific situations.
    Some messages comes along with voice audio.
    v2.0 - Now we have a more organized menu, with more than one page.
    v2.0 - Muriatic Acid, Hydrogen Chloride and Caustic Soda options just will only appear if you are in Cook Off, Lab Rats or Rats.
    v2.0 - If you are on the first day of Hotline Miami will also appear the options of chemicals and city locations to find the barcodes. All this in a third page of the menu.
    v2.0 - QuickMenu to SimpleMenu.

Installation:
